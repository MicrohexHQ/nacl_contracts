#Ripple Contracts Test Application

This is a repository for the development of preliminary smart contracts functionality for the Ripple network.

It utilizes Google's Native Client (https://developers.google.com/native-client/dev/) for sandboxing/software fault isolation.

A contract is untrusted code run as a Native Client (NaCl) .nexe executable file.

A set of calls are made available to the contract in order to interact with the Ripple ledger.
